<h3>A Summary Of Me</h3>
<p>
 	I live in New York. I live in Westchester county. I have a dog and 3 little siblings. 	My favorite color is purple. I am 12 years old. I like elephants. One wall of my room is purple. I like to make stuff. Origami, toilet paper rolls, paper crafts, yarn, and cardboard. I make lots of things out of 	stuff like that. I  am knitting a scarf. I even made myself a tail out of toilet paper rolls. I am homeschooled. I am in 7th grade. There is a lot of work, but it's still fine.
